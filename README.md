### Hi there 👋

### Welcome to My AI Journey! 🚀
🎓 Hi there! I'm a passionate Graduate Student Assistant at Arizona State University, fueling the minds of budding data enthusiasts in the Statistical Learning course. Beyond the classroom, I'm on a quest for a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, where I dive deep into the realms of computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, and data engineering.

🛠️ In my recent endeavor, I crafted a predictive model centering around Parkinson's disease, weaving the magic of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn into the fabric of innovation.

🌐 On my professional pilgrimage at KPIT - Honda ADAS India, I danced across the intersection of software engineering and AI. Picture this: Collaborating seamlessly to transform user dreams into tangible design documents, I brought C++ and Python to life in the creation and deployment of Machine Learning models. Handling mammoth datasets of 1 million images, I orchestrated a symphony of efficiency by optimizing Python libraries into high-performance C++ code, slashing computational overhead by a cool 40%. The icing on the cake? I took the reins of deploying specialized ML models on AWS EC2 P3 instances, harnessing GPU-accelerated computing for an extra dash of magic.

🚀 But that's not all – during my internship escapades, I wielded my coding wand to conjure up efficient image processing kernels, speeding up operations by a nifty 30% and trimming memory usage by 25%. I sprinkled in some CV magic with algorithms like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and R-CNN, revealing intricate patterns and anomalies in images and boosting data extraction accuracy by a dazzling 35%. And to top it off, I whipped up a scalable Python framework that automated image checks, bringing a 70% reduction in manual tasks.

🌈 A firm believer in the power of collaboration, I thrived in rigorous code reviews, sculpting code quality and fostering readability across the team's codebase.

🚀 Excited about the intersection of AI, machine learning, and software development, my goal is to sprinkle my diverse skill set and hands-on experience onto cutting-edge AI applications and systems.

Ready to embark on this journey with me? Let's code the future together! 🚀👩‍💻
